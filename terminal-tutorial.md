# First Contribution

## Introduction

#### [](https://github.com/Syknapse/Contribute-To-This-Project#this-is-a-tutorial-to-help-first-time-contributors-to-participate-in-a-simple-and-easy-project)This is a tutorial to help first-time contributors to participate in a simple and easy project.

# Objectives

- Make a contribution to an open source project.
- Get more comfortable in using GitHub.

# Who is this for?

- This is for absolute beginners. If you know how to write and edit an anchor tag `<a href="" target=""></a>` then you should be able to do it.
- It is also for those with a little more experience but who want to make their first open source contribution, or get more contributions for more experience and confidence.

# Why do I need to do this

Any web developer, aspiring or experienced needs to use Git version control, and GitHub is the most popular Git hosting service used by everyone. It is also the heart of the Open Source community. Getting comfortable using GitHub is an essential skill. Making a contribution to a project boosts your confidence and gives you something to show on your GitHub profile.<br>
If you are a new developer and you are wondering if you need to learn Git and GitHub then here is the answer: [You Should've Learned Git Yesterday](https://codeburst.io/number-one-piece-of-advice-for-new-developers-ddd08abc8bfa 'New Developer? You shouldâ€™ve learned Git yesterday. by Brandon Morelli, creator of CodeBurst.io').

# Setup!

First let's get setup to do the work.
If you're not not good with the command line interface [here is the GUI tutorial using github desktop](./README.md)

- If you dont have git [install it from here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

# Step 1 Fork This Repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="./readme-only/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

- The objective here is to make a copy of this project and place it in your account.
- A repository (repo) is how a project is called on GitHub and a fork is a copy of it.
- Make sure you are on the [main page](https://github.com/Syknapse/Contribute-To-This-Project 'https://github.com/Syknapse/Contribute-To-This-Project') of this repo.

# Step 2 Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="./readme-only/clone-terminal.png" alt="fork this repository" />
- Now we want to make a local copy of the project.<br> That is a copy saved on your own machine.
Now clone this repo to your machine. Click on the clone button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```
